# Project Title

WYT-Rails is a Yahoo Fantasy Sports Tool Helper for all the users that wants to ask for an opinion about their current trade. Currently people send it to their friends by a screenshot. One problem here is that, the stats can differ day by day and it can be hard to track all the comments and opinions about the trade if they're going to search it in their chatboxes. Our app solves it by creating a mock trade on our website and the users can send the link to their friends, and non users can judge and share their opinions. Technically, only users with Yahoo Fantasy Teams on NBA are eligible to use most of the features.
